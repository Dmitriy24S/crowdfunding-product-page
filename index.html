            The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish platform that elevates your
            screen to a more comfortable viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the
            potential to improve your posture and make you more comfortable while at work, helping
            you stay focused on the task at hand.
          </p>
          <p class="project-text__paragraph">
            Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the simplicity of design creates extra desk space below
            your computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be stored under the stand.
